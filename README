camview is a simple two-client camera viewing program.

Requirements:
	* OpenCV

Installation:
	* Modify config.h to suit your preferences.

	* Run ``make camview'' to build the client.

	* Run ``make camserv'' to build the server.

	* Copy the binaries and images to the directories you want.

Running:
	* Run camserv like so: ``camserv [port-number]''.

	* Run camview like so: ``camview host-ip [port-number]''.

	* The default port number used by the program is 1234 (UDP). You may
	need to forward that port if you're running the server behind a router.

	* Only two clients are currently supported.

	* Both clients should have unique network addresses. You may run the
	client on the same machine that you run the server.

License:
	* See LICENSE.
